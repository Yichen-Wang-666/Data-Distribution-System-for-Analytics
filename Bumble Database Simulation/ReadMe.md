## Bumble Database

### Overview of the Business Scenario

We have decided to build a dating app database inspired by the model of Bumble. Bumble is a free dating app that rapidly got popular thanks to its “girls make the first step” approach (female users are the ones that initiate a discussion). Bumble alike the various other dating apps offers the basic functionalities of a dating app:<br />
- Connecting people with complementary profiles, based on various features<br />
o Gender <br />
o Sexual orientation <br />
o Location <br />
o Hobbies<br />
o Lifestyle (smoking, drinking…)<br />
o Opinions (religion, politics…)<br />
- Secondly, Bumble has a subscription-based model, meaning users can subscribe to different offers to access additional features:<br />
o unlimited number of swipes per day<br />
o cancelling swipes<br />
o and more…<br />
- We decided to add that subscription approach in our model, as well as develop further functionalities:<br />
o Premium allows you to manually change your location<br />
o The possibility to host and attend events:<br />
▪ Indeed, few dating apps today offer to their users tailored events to their needs: dating, making friends etc.<br />
▪ By understanding our users, we aim at offering a new way of connecting with each other, away from your phone.<br />
- Lastly, we explored how our model enables us to create value from the data, to perform:<br />
o User targeting / user analytics:<br />
▪ Understand the demographics of our customer base and tailor more personalised experiences.<br />
▪ Find trends in our data: e.g., popular hobbies in a segment of our users<br />
▪ Sponsor events or users to the appropriate audience<br />
o Financial metrics<br />
▪ Find conversion rate of our subscription model<br />
o Performance metrics<br />
▪ Evaluate the algorithm’s suggestion capability (the average amount of swipes per month): this metric is vital to understand if our dating app is useful: if a user must perform a lot of swipes, then he doesn’t meet “the one” quickly enough.<br />
▪ Evaluate our premium plan’s efficiency:<br />
• Do our premium members get higher number of matches?<br />
